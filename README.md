# JavaScript Form Validation Project

This is a basic web form created using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The form includes validation for fields like Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password. It checks for input correctness and displays error messages if the input is invalid.

The project is designed to show how form validation can be done using plain JavaScript without any external libraries.
